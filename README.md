# Mechatronics-Design-Project
University of Bath IDE 4th Year Mechatronics Module

Built a Mobile Robot that can operate Semi-Autonomously: The robot needs to be able to act based on instructions and not only under direct control (i.e. RC type control) 
The robot should be able to navigate around: The robot should be able to move in a walled environment, ideally avoiding obstacles. 
Detect a visible feature and move towards it: The robot will need to detect a visible feature (QR-like code, colour target, etc.) approach it and stop. 
The robot should communicate with other systems: the robot will need to communicate at least with Mission Control (a PC on the same network), ideally with an on-board sensor, and another robot. 
The robot will interact with a contraption of the teams making: Some form of physical contraption will need to be built. It will need to have a physical and ideally communication element. 

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS 
1. You must use the Arduino MKR1000 provided.
2. You must use a camera (on-board or stationary).
3. You must use a battery 
4. You must build atleast one spherical robot. 
5. The contraption must have a physical interaction with the robot and can communicate with the robot. 
6. You can use any software tool but Simulink and Python are encouraged.
